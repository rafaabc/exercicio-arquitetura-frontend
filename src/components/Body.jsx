    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As a QA engineer, I believe that technology can help us in many aspects, from ordering food to buying stocks in the financial market. Because of that, it’s our responsibility to ensure that people using the technology have good experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm hardworking and committed to bringing the best testing and quality to the software development life cycle (SDLC).
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who values knowledge sharing, I’ve recently spoken about how quality assurance should start as early as possible in the SDLC at TSPI Conference 2020 (a Brazilian conference about software testing).

        I’m experienced with Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, Rest-Assured, BrowserStack, JMeter, Cypress, MySQL, Postman, git, Maven, CircleCI, and Jira, and I’m well versed in Java and JavaScript programming languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least, I’m experienced with SCRUM and Kanban methodologies.
